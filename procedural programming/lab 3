Task 1 - Given 2 integers you need to find their sum. You must implement a function int Sum(int a, int b).

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int Sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    int num1, num2;
    cin >> num1;
    cin >> num2;

    int result = Sum(num1, num2);
    cout << result;

    return 0;
}

Task 2 - 

------------------
Task 16 - Given a matrix of size NxM. 
Change all elements that are smaller than average of all elements to value of element in last row and first column multiplied by 2.
In the main() function you are only allowed to declare variables and call functions
All variables to functions must be passed as pointers
All variables in functions must be pointers, arrays should be accessed/modified only with arrow operators
Matrix should be saved in dynamic memory and memory should be freed after all calculations
